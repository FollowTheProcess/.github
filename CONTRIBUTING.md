# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project! This guide is intended to provide an overview of how you can get involved ðŸš€

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README] file. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub]
- [Set up Git]
- [GitHub flow]
- [Collaborating with pull requests]

## Ways to Contribute

### Issues

If you're using the project and find a bug, or have a specific feature request, or just a question about how to do something, you can raise a GitHub issue.

> [!TIP]
> It's always a good idea to search through the existing issues first (even the closed ones) to see if there's anything that might answer your question already out there

You can also solve an issue with a pull request, see [Pull Requests](#pull-requests) or just by answering someone elses question

### Pull Requests

The general process goes like this:

- Fork the repository to create a new repo you own called `<your username>/<repo>`
- Set up the repo by following instructions in the [README]
- Create a new branch and make your changes (be sure to write good tests if it's a code change!)
- Commit your update and push your branch
- Then open a PR âœ¨

Your PR will be reviewed and changes may or may not be requested, then if/when the PR is accepted, your change will be merged and become part of the main project!

> [!NOTE]
> Changes and improvements to documentation are just as valuable as changes to source code!
